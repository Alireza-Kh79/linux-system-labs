# Linux Labs

This repository is a collection of hands-on Linux system administration labs.

The purpose of this repository is to practice and document real-world Linux
scenarios through experimentation, configuration, and troubleshooting rather
than theory or exam-style notes.

## Scope

This repository focuses on practical work around:

- Linux system administration fundamentals
- User and permission management
- Process and service management
- Networking and remote access
- Storage and filesystem concepts
- System security basics
- Logging, monitoring, and troubleshooting

---

## Approach

Each lab is treated as a small real-world scenario:
- A problem or goal is defined
- The system is configured accordingly
- Behavior is observed through logs and tools
- Findings and lessons are documented

The emphasis is on understanding system behavior, not just applying commands.

## Environment

Labs are performed in virtualized Linux environments using common distributions
and standard tools typically found in production systems.

## Notes

This repository represents personal hands-on practice and learning.
Configurations and approaches may vary depending on system requirements
and should be adapted before use in production environments.
